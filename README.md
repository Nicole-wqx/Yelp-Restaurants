Found the features that can predict restaurant’s open status on Yelp using Logistic Regression.

***Background***

Yelp's delivery service feature needs a model to accurately determine whether a restaurant is currently in business (open/permanently closed) based on its reviews.

Predicting a restaurant is open when it’s closed (False Positive) will lead to failed delivery attempts and users' dissatisfaction. Predicting a restaurant is closed when it’s open (False Negatives) results in missed revenue opportunities.

## STEP 1: Logistic Regression Model and Thresholding

## STEP 2: Model Evaluation
K-fold Cross-Validation is used to evaluate the model.
